Replacing old mdp entry 'xtc-grps' by 'compressed-x-grps'
Replacing old mdp entry 'xtc-precision' by 'compressed-x-precision'

NOTE 1 [file adp_T300.mdp]:
  The group cutoff scheme is deprecated since GROMACS 5.0 and will be
  removed in a future release when all interaction forms are supported for
  the verlet scheme. The verlet scheme already scales better, and it is
  compatible with GPUs and other accelerators.

Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -deffnm adp_T300

Compiled SIMD: None, but for this host/run AVX_512 might be better (see log).
The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
gmx mdrun was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding gmx mdrun with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.

NOTE: This file uses the deprecated 'group' cutoff_scheme. This will be
removed in a future release when 'verlet' supports all interaction forms.
